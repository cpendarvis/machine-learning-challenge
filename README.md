Highlights

- I employed a logistic regression model and a deep learning model to complete homework. Based on the results of both models, it's clear that the deep learning model is more complex to build but it is more accurate. 

After using GridSearch to tune the logistic regression model parameters, I was able to obtain a 0.8178746409866532 accuracy level with 'C': 1, and a 'penalty' of  l1, which is 0.007433688 higher than the testing score. With the Normal Neural Network the score was much higher, the accuracy level increased up to 0.8307146479258124, which is 0.012840007 higher than the highest score from the first model. 

- I believe the deep learning model is an excellent tool to predict new exoplanets because it's more than 80% accurate. 

- The accuracy of the model could be better by adding more features and additonal hidden leyers.
